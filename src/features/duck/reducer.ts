/**
 * @description Reducers
 * It's a good practice to keep your **state shape** in a comment above the reducers, just to have
 * an overview.
 *
 * In case the state shape is more complex, you should break the reducers into multiple smaller
 * functions that deal with a slice of the state, then combine them at the end.
 *
 * NOTE: Let's keep it simple for now with `switch` statements and abstract later.
