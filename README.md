Coding challenge for `ToolTime`. </br>
This project has been bootstrapped with my personal react typescript boilerplate => [boilerplate--ts_project_starter-react](https://github.com/suddenlyGiovanni/boilerplate--ts_project_starter-react).

Some of the features that it provides:

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- Typescript
- React
- Redux (type-safe actions / duck pattern)
- Jest
- testing-library/react
- testing-library/cypress
- Wallaby.js (for better user experience with TDD)
- Cyperss (for Integration and end-to-end test)
- Commitizen (to help with commits messages)
- Commitlint
